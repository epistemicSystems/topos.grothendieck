# Comprehensive Quality Check

Runs a comprehensive quality assessment on a lesson or component, checking mathematical correctness, pedagogy, performance, and more.

## Usage

```
/quality-check ITEM_PATH
```

**Example:**
```
/quality-check packages/lessons/module-01/lesson-1.1
/quality-check packages/core/src/components/math/CategoryDiagram.tsx
```

## Check Categories

### 1. Mathematical Correctness âœ“

Verifies mathematical accuracy:

- [ ] **Definitions are precise**: No ambiguity, standard terminology
- [ ] **Examples are correct**: Verified mathematically
- [ ] **Theorems stated accurately**: Proper hypotheses and conclusions
- [ ] **Notation is consistent**: Follows conventions in CLAUDE.md
- [ ] **Proofs are rigorous** (if included): No logical gaps
- [ ] **Diagrams commute**: All claimed commutative diagrams actually commute
- [ ] **Calculations correct**: Symbolic manipulations are valid

**How We Check**:
- Manual review of mathematical content
- Cross-reference with standard texts
- Verify examples with symbolic computation
- Test edge cases

**Pass Criteria**: No mathematical errors found

---

### 5. Technical Quality ðŸ’»

Validates code and performance:

- [ ] **Code well-structured**: Clean, organized, understandable
- [ ] **Components reusable**: Not overly coupled
- [ ] **TypeScript strict mode**: No `any` types, all typed
- [ ] **Performance optimized**: 60fps, fast load times
- [ ] **No memory leaks**: Profiled and verified
- [ ] **Bundles successfully**: Single HTML output works
- [ ] **No console errors**: Clean console
- [ ] **Tests pass**: All unit and integration tests
- [ ] **Accessible**: WCAG AA compliance

**How We Check**:
- TypeScript compiler
- ESLint/Prettier
- Bundle size analysis
- Performance profiling
- Memory leak detection
- Accessibility audit

**Pass Criteria**: TypeScript strict passes, bundle <5MB, no errors

---

### 6. Accessibility Quality â™¿

Ensures everyone can learn:

- [ ] **Keyboard navigable**: Full functionality without mouse
- [ ] **Screen reader friendly**: Proper ARIA labels
- [ ] **Sufficient contrast**: WCAG AA minimum
- [ ] **Focus visible**: Clear focus indicators
- [ ] **Alt text provided**: Images have descriptions
- [ ] **No flashing content**: Safe for photosensitive users
- [ ] **Resizable text**: Works at 200% zoom
- [ ] **Semantic HTML**: Proper heading structure

**How We Check**:
- Lighthouse accessibility audit
- axe DevTools
- Manual keyboard testing
- Screen reader testing (NVDA/JAWS)
- Color contrast analyzer

**Pass Criteria**: Lighthouse accessibility score >90

## Automated Checks

The command runs automated tools:

```bash
# TypeScript
tsc --noEmit --strict

# Linting

npm test

# Bundle
npm run build

# Accessibility
lighthouse --only-categories=accessibility

# Performance
lighthouse --only-categories=performance
```

## Manual Review Checklist

Some checks require human judgment:

- Mathematical correctness review
- Pedagogical effectiveness
- Design aesthetics
- Hint quality
- Example selection

---

## Tips

- **Run early and often**: Don't wait until the end
- **Address warnings**: They often become issues later
- **100% math correctness**: Non-negotiable
- **User test**: Best way to find usability issues
